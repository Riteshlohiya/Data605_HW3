#                             ASSIGNMENT 3

#           IS 605 FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS

#                            Problem set 1

1. What is the rank of the matrix A?

```{r}
rank = 0
A <- matrix(c(1, -1, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 4, 3,1 -2, -2,4,3,1,-3), nrow=4, ncol=4) 
A
```

Rank of the matrix using qr function:

```{r}
rank <- qr(A)$rank
rank
```

The rank is 4

2. Given an mxn matrix where m > n, what can be the maximum rank? The minimum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

The Matrix can have a maximum rank of rank(A)=n and mininum rank of 1

3. What is the rank of matrix B?

```{r}
B<-matrix(c(1,2,1,3,6,3,2,4,2), byrow =TRUE,nrow = 3,ncol = 3)
qr(B)$rank
```

The rank is 1
